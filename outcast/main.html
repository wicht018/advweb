			<p class="entryblock">Representation in media is critical for LGBTQ groups who can often feel invisible or ignored in the real world. The past several years have seen a welcome increase in the number of LGBTQ roles in film and television, but many of these roles continue to miss the mark when it comes to accurately communicating LGBTQ stories. Characters written without depth or that adhere to harmful stereotypes may do more damage to the community than no representation at all. Take a look at the visualizations below and decide for yourself, are you seeing the real picture of LGBTQ lives, or just an altered projection?</p>

			<p class="title1">representation by race</p>
			<p class="caption1">Research from the GLAAD Media Institute has found disparities betweeen the racial makeup of America and the races of LGBTQ characters on television. While representation of people of color has greatly improved, strides can still be made with groups such as Latinx and those with disabilities.

			These graphs show the percentages of various racial groups within the U.S. population and their corresponding percentage of LGBTQ characters on broadcast, cable, and streaming televison.</p>

			<p class="title2">the vito-russo test</p>
			<p class="caption2">GLAAD has developed a three-step test, similar to the Bechdel test for accurate portrayal of women in film, which determines the success of LGBTQ roles at achieving depth of character. In many forms of media, especially that of the mainstream, LGBTQ characters are used as "tokens," mostly there to provide the occasional laugh. They serve as the backup for the hetero- and gender-normative main characters.
				<br><br>
			This is an analysis of the top 10 films or franchises with an LGBTQ character using the Vito-Russo Test.</p>

			<p class="title3">stereotypes</p>
			<p class="caption3">There are countless tropes seen in the portrayals of LGBTQ characters and stories. Shallow assumptions based on appearance and mannerisms are common, but deeper inaccuracies such as criminal behavior lead to the continued perception that LGBTQ people are immoral or dangerous.

			The top 10 grossing films featuring an LGBTQ character as the lead are shown in this graphic. While most of these films are viewed as important milestones of LGBTQ representation, it is evident that they may also perpetuate stereotypes.</p>
